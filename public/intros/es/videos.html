    <p class="no-indent">Welcome to Lexsitus-Lectures, the audio-visual resource of Lexsitus. Lexsitus-Lectures offers
        free access to more than
        230 lectures in English (and several lectures spoken in other languages). There are more
        than 55 lecturers, among them some of the leading experts in the world on international criminal law and a
        number of
        practitioners from international criminal jurisdictions.</p>
    <p> All lectures are subtitled in the spoken language. The more than 230 English lectures are also subtitled in
        Arabic, French and Persian.The subtitle button is easy to find in the
        lower-right corner of the video screen once you have started a film. The tutorial film linked to above shows you
        where
        you find the films and how you can play them.</p>
    <p>Most lectures are classified as ‘Introductory’, some as ‘Advanced’. The ‘Advanced’ lectures are usually 30
        minutes or
        longer, or they address a more specialised aspect or context of a provision.</p>
    <p>All articles and main provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court are covered by at least one
        introductory lecture; quite a number of the more important provisions, by an advanced lecture. In the coming
        years,
        select advanced lectures will be added to Lexsitus.</p>
    <p> You find the links to the films in the red menu on the left. When you click on the provision that you are
        interested in,
        the list of relevant films will open in the central field of the page (where you are reading this). When you
        click on
        the film that seems most relevant to you, three sub-fields open in the central field: the video screen at the
        upper-centre of the page; below on the left, the registered search data for this particular film; and on the
        right, any
        other films that may be available on the selected article. </p>


    <p> Among the search- or metadata for each film you find the persistent URLs of the lecture in Lexsitus and of the
        written transcript of the lecture as a
        downloadable PDF-file in the ICC Legal Tools Database. As both the film and the separate transcript file have
        permanent
        URLs, you can safely hyperlink to either in your own writing and publications. You simply click on the copy-icon
        above
        and paste it into the notes field on the right or directly into your own document. If you have logged into
        Lexsitus (see
        the user-icon at the upper corner on the far right), you can also save the film in your personalised
        reading list
        by clicking on the plus-icon next to the copy-icon.</p>
    <p>
        The logical structure of Lexsitus is based on the Statute of the International Criminal Court. On the far-left
        side, you
        can always consult the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Court when you work or study in
        Lexsitus.
        The Lectures supplement these and other textual resources in Lexsitus, such as the CLICC commentary. In the row
        immediately above, you see and can access all the available Lexsitus resources.

        project) and in-kind support from the Canadian Partnership for International Justice. Laval’s French Production
