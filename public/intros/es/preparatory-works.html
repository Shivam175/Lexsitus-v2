		This Lexsitus resource allows you to find preparatory works documents relevant to the making and understanding of the ICC Statute. You find the documents by going to the green Menu on your left. The Menu is first structured into the Preamble and Parts 1-13 of the Statute. On the next level, you find the clusters of documents (first one cluster organized by Part, then clusters organized by Article). By clicking on the hook in front of the cluster that interests you, a scrollable list of documents will appear. 
        </p>

        <p>
		      When you click on the title of one of the documents, it will open in the central field (where you are now), from where you can read, download or print it. By using the plus-button in the green banner above the document, you can also add it to your reading list (for which you need to log-in in the upper-right corner of Lexsitus). The button to the immediate left in the same green banner allows you to copy the document title, its date and persistent URL in the ICC Legal Tools Database (‘LTD’) into the notes field on the right or your own document. In the left corner of the green banner in the central field (where you are reading now), you can click to see some metadata of the document, including its persistent URL in the LTD.

		       The Preparatory Works resource in Lexsitus draws on the ‘ICC Preparatory Works and Statute Amendments Collection’ in the LTD which contains more than 8,900 documents. It is the largest collection of these preparatory works available online, prepared by a team led by Mr. Enrique Carnero Rojo in the Legal Advisory Section of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor in 2003-05. The organization of the documents into clusters by Part or Article of the ICC Statute has been made possible by a team led by Dr. Cyril Laucci (including Dr. ZHU Dan and Ms. Margherita Stevoli). Their work is also available in the ICC Preparatory Works Search service (‘ICCPWS’) in CILRAP’s CMN Knowledge Hub (to which there is a link in the top banner of this page). We owe these colleagues a debt of gratitude.
