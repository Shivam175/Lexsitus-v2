            The Commentary on the Law of the International Criminal Court (CLICC) provides a provision-by-provision
            analysis of the
            Rome Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Court (‘ICC’). CLICC
            enables the user
            to find case-law, doctrine and comments efficiently and without cost. With Lexsitus you can create reading
            lists and

            <strong>How to use:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="no-indent">
            CLICC is an integral part of the Lexsitus platform. Lexsitus offers access to a set of resources that are
            organized
            around the provisions of the ICC Statute as the primary spine or taxonomy. You click on ‘Rome Statute’ on
            your far left
            to open the spine of the Statute (it will appear in a column with grey background colour). There is a
            second spine below, also on your far left, for when you want to access CLICC for the ICC Rules of Procedure
            and
            Evidence: you select a Rule by moving your mouse over it, and then clicking on the ‘Populate tabs’ icon to
            its left
            (which looks like three columns).
