            This Lexsitus resource reproduces the ICC Elements of Crimes document (‘EoC’) in Lexsitus. It contains elements of the
            crimes included in Articles 6, 7, 8 and 8bis of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. According to Article
            9(1) of the Statute, the EoC document “shall assist the Court in the interpretation and application of Articles 6, 7, 8
            and 8 bis”. The document is adopted by the members of the ICC Assembly of States Parties (two-thirds majority
            requirement). The EoC helps you to better understand the definition of the ICC crimes. It is included in Lexsitus as a
            core document in the ICC’s legal infrastructure alongside its Statute and Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

You find the elements of a crime by going to the sharp-orange Menu on your left. The Menu is structured into a ‘General
introduction’ and then Articles 6, 7, 8 and 8bis of the ICC Statute, following the EoC order. At the next level, the
Article-sections (except 8bis) start with an ‘Introduction’ with general information included in the EoC, followed by a
list of crimes (in Article 6) or clusters of crimes (Articles 7 and 8).

        <p>
When you click on the dark hook in front of the crime you are looking for, the list of elements will open in the central
field (where you are now), from where you can read or copy the text. By using the plus-button in the orange banner above
the document, you can also add it to your reading list (for which you need to log-in in the upper-right corner of
Lexsitus). The button to the immediate left in the same orange banner allows you to copy the citation of the EoC
(including its persistent URL in the ICC Legal Tools Database) into the notes field on the right or your own document.
