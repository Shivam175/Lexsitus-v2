		This Lexsitus resource allows you to find some judicial decisions relevant to select provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. The resource does not aim to be exhaustive in the selection of decisions.
	</p>
        <p>
		       You find the documents by going to the blue Menu on your left. The Menu is structured into the Preamble, Parts and Articles of the ICC Statute. Articles or sub-paragraphs for which decisions have been included will have a small dark hook on the left. See, for example, Article 6 or 15 and its sub-paragraphs. By clicking on the hook in front of the cluster that interests you, a scrollable list of documents will appear in reverse chronological order.

        <p>
		      When you click on the title of one of the documents, it will open in the central field (where you are now), from where you can read, download or print it. By using the plus-button in the blue banner above the document, you can also add it to your reading list (for which you need to log-in in the upper-right corner of Lexsitus). The button to the immediate left in the same blue banner allows you to copy the document’s jurisdiction, title, date and persistent URL in the ICC Legal Tools Database (‘LTD’) into the notes field on the right or your own document. In the left corner of the blue banner in the central field (where you are now), you can click to see some metadata of the document, including its persistent URL in the LTD.
